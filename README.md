# weather-app
A HTML 5 Web App to check weather forecast for 5 days of the selected location by user.
The app is a simple javascript and HTML 5 web app. To deploy, just copy the files to a root location of the server and try to access the application by starting the server.
To make the application more employee friendly, I can do the following things:-
Make it more interactive by using CSS.
Adding images from the api to make good look and feel.
Also make it unit dependent i.e. the temperature can be either metric(Temperature in Celcius) or imperial(Temperature in Kelvin). Currently, the unit of measurement is imperial.
We can also add humidity factor and wind speed for the user to watch.
